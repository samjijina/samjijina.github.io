I am an undergraduate student studying computer science at the Georgia Institute of Technology since Fall 2016. My concentration is in Systems-Architecture and Intelligence. I am currently a senior graduating in Spring 2020 after which I plan on continuing my education by getting a master’s degree and eventually a PhD.


My research interests are in high-performance computer architecture, specifically, instruction level parallelism (ILP), simultaneous multithreading (SMT), tournament branch predictors, computer architecture optimizations for artificial intelligence, and GPGPU architecture.


Currently, I work in the High-Performance Architecture Lab as an undergraduate student researcher. More information about my research can be found [here](https://samjijina.github.io/research).


Outside of academia, my hobbies include playing golf, soccer, and building PC’s.
