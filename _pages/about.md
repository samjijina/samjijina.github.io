I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) and am being advised by Professor Hyesoon Kim of the HPArch Research Lab. My specilization is Computer Architecture with a special focus on architecting hardware designs to support IoT and autonomous applications.


## More About Me

I also obtained my M.S CS degree from Georgia Tech in May 2022 and have been involved in research since 2019. I have worked on several projects ranging from MacSim, a heterogenous timing simulator, to Vortex which is an open source RISC-V based GPGPU. The research problems which I find to be fundamental to the future of our field are post-Moore computing and Beyond CMOS technology.


Outside of academia, my hobbies include amatuer astronomy, soccer, table tennis, and recreational golf.
