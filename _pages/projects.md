## Fall 2019
* FPGA Robot Arm Control
  * Developed Verilog code for the Altera DE0 FPGA which utilized closed feedback-loops to control multiple DC servos in the MeArm robot arm.
  * [Code Base](https://github.com/samjijina/fpga-arm-control)
* Virtual Syllabus Agent using NLP and KBAI
  * Developed a python agent which can input questions asked from users and use NLP to decode the question. The agent is also able to learn using Incremental Concept Learning and is able to use Thematic Roles to reply to the user.
  * [Initial Agent Design](https://samjijina.github.io/files/AI_P1.pdf)
  * [Partially Complete Agent Design](https://samjijina.github.io/files/AI_P2.pdf)
  * [Complete Agent Design](https://samjijina.github.io/files/AI_P3.pdf)

## Summer 2019
* Dynamic A* Path Planning on NavMesh map
  * Developed an agent which implements A* path planning on a NavMesh map with dynamic obstacles.

## Spring 2019
* E1000 x86 Network Driver for xv6
  * Developed a network driver for the e1000 NIC for the xv6 operating system.
  * This network driver (written in ANSI C) enabled the communication between multiple simultaneous instances of the xv6 shell.
  * [Code Base](https://github.com/samjijina/xv6-network-driver-code)
* Text Editor for xv6
  * Developed a text editor (with custom system calls added) for the xv6 operating system.
  * [Code Base](https://github.com/samjijina/xv6-text-editor)

## Fall 2018
* Multi-layered Neural Net with Back Propagation
  * Developed a multi-layered Neural Net with feed-forward processing of inputs and back propagation to update network weight.
  * The perceptronsâ€™ weight was also updated using a Sigmoid function and update.

## Summer 2018
* Anki Cozmo Facial Recognition
  * Developed facial recognition software and sequences for the Anki Cozmo programmable robot.
