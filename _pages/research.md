## Fall 2019
Currently, I work in the High-Performance Architecture Research Lab at Georgia Tech as an undergraduate student researcher. My team’s work this past semester has been on developing a Raspberry Pi-powered drone capable of running an AI cognitive agent to support autonomous flight. I worked to program the drone to run advanced waypoint navigation algorithms and accurately fly the shortest path in 3D space. Next semester, I am planning on taking this project even further using detailed performance analyses, more powerful cognitive agents, and an ASIC chip with custom drone flight control architecture. You can view our test flight demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EmQX5hJeWg). We also submitted a prototype demonstration paper to the CogArch 2020 workshop relating to our findings and progress. Please also visit our lab websites:

I also adopted a small research project, called the “FPGA Robot Arm Control”.  During this project, I developed Verilog code for the Altera DE0 FPGA which utilized closed feedback-loops to control multiple DC servos in the MeArm robot arm. The results of the project looked promising and future students would be able to extend my work even further.

## Spring 2020
This upcoming Spring, I am very excited to be working as a full-time undergraduate student researcher with the HPArch Research Lab! [More details to come soon]
